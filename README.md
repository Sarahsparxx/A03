Branch: Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository.

Clone: The clone command is used to create a copy of a specific repository or branch within a repository.

Commit: Commit captures a snapshot of your repository. These commits are snapshots of your entire repository at specific times.

Fetch: Fetch is used to retrieve new work done by other people. Fetching from a repository grabs all the new remote-tracking branches and tags without merging those changes into your own branches. Otherwise, you can always add a new remote and then fetch.

GIT: GIT is a local VCS software that enables developers to save snapshots of their projects over time.

Github: GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. 

Merge: The merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.

Merge Conflict: Merge conflicts happen when you merge branches that have competing commits, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge.

Push: push updates the remote branch with local commits. It is one of the four commands in Git that prompts interaction with the remote repository.

Pull: Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.

Remote: A remote is the server where your code is stored.

Repository: A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.
